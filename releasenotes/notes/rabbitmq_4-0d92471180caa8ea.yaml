    Please, make sure you are running RabbitMQ version of 3.13 before
    proceeding with the upgrade.
    In case you RabbitMQ version is lower then 3.13 upgrade to 4.0 will

    You can run upgrade to 3.13 with same version of role by
    supplying variable ``rabbitmq_package_version`` during runtime, for
    example:
    ``openstack-ansible openstack.osa.rabbitmq_server -e rabbitmq_upgrade=true -e rabbitmq_package_version=3.13.7-1``
    and then re-running upgrade normally to 4.0.
